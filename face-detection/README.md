# Face Detection

## Description
This design detects human faces from an image using the Viola Jones algorithm. The design is directly adopted from the "Parallel and Pipelined" implementation by N. Srivastava et al. If you use this benchmark in your research, please also cite the FPGA'17 paper by N.Srivastava et al.:
